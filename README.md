# The CACAPO Dataset

CACAPO is a data-to-text dataset that contains sentences from news reports for the sports, weather, stock, and incidents domain in English and Dutch, aligned with relevant attribute-value paired data. This is the first data-to-text dataset based on "naturally occurring" human-written texts (i.e., texts that were not collected in a task-based setting), that covers various domains, as well as multiple languages. A description of the dataset can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.10.pdf).

<h2>This GitHub page</h2>
This GitHub page contains the "thin" version of the texts in the dataset, which means the annotated data, combined with links to the collected texts. Furthermore it contains the tools used to collect these texts.
